# **2048-Multiplayer**


## ***Small 2048 multiplayer version from https://github.com/Rotmuetze/Python-2048.***

Tested with Python 3.12.2

Used [auto py to exe](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe) from [brentvollebregt](https://github.com/brentvollebregt) for an executable file

### To start, either start Python files or start the exe files in the 2048-Server and 2048-Client folders:


[Client.exe](https://github.com/Rotmuetze/Python-2048_Multiplayer/tree/main/2048-Client)

[Server.exe](https://github.com/Rotmuetze/Python-2048_Multiplayer/tree/main/2048-Server)

[Client.py](https://github.com/Rotmuetze/Python-2048_Multiplayer/blob/main/2048-Client.py)

[Server.py](https://github.com/Rotmuetze/Python-2048_Multiplayer/blob/main/2048-Server.py)

## Small Note
### This is a small project so here are some small issues/Problmes:

- Please use the IP that is giving out from the Server to connect
- You need to install [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) from [TomSchimansky](https://github.com/TomSchimansky) (Should be installed automatically when opening the Client but who knows)
  and of course Python... (Who would have thought it xD)
