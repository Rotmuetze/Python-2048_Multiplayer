Small 2048 multiplayer from https://github.com/Rotmuetze/Python-2048.
To start, either start Python files or start the exe in the 2048-Server and 2048-Client folders:


[Client.exe](https://github.com/Rotmuetze/Python-2048_Multiplayer/tree/main/2048-Client)
[Server.exe](https://github.com/Rotmuetze/Python-2048_Multiplayer/tree/main/2048-Server)
[Client.py](https://github.com/Rotmuetze/Python-2048_Multiplayer/blob/main/2048-Client.py)
[Server.py](https://github.com/Rotmuetze/Python-2048_Multiplayer/blob/main/2048-Server.py)

This is a small project so here are some small issues:

Please use the IP that is giving out from the Server to connect.
